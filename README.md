# Simple Calculator

A basic calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Overview

This calculator provides basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The intuitive user interface makes calculations easy, with a clean and straightforward design.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Used for structuring the web content.
- **CSS**: Provides styling and theming to make the calculator look appealing.
- **JavaScript**: Powers the calculator's operations, ensuring accurate and fast calculations.

## How to Use

1. Open the calculator in your preferred web browser.
2. Use the numeric buttons to enter numbers.
3. Use the operation buttons (+, -, \*, /) to perform arithmetic operations.
4. Press the "=" button to see the result.
5. Use the "C" or "AC" button to clear the input or reset the calculator.

## What I Learned

During the process of creating this simple calculator, my understanding of JavaScript and its integration with HTML and CSS was significantly enriched:

1. **DOM Manipulation**: By fetching elements using methods like `getElementById` and `querySelectorAll`, I became proficient in DOM manipulation, a cornerstone of interactive web development.

2. **Event Handling**: Implementing the calculator's functionality deepened my knowledge of event listeners. By binding the `handleButtonClick` function to each button's click event, I learned how to trigger specific JS functions based on user interactions.

3. **Conditional Logic in JS**: Deciding when to execute arithmetic operations, when to accumulate digits for a number, and handling various edge cases (like divide by zero) solidified my understanding of conditional statements in JavaScript.

4. **Integration of HTML, CSS, and JS**: Building this calculator made me realize the importance of seamless integration between structure (HTML), style (CSS), and functionality (JS). It provided a practical demonstration of how these technologies intertwine to produce dynamic web pages.

5. **Debugging and Error Handling**: Ensuring that the calculator displays "Error" in edge cases taught me the basics of error handling and emphasized the importance of thorough testing.

Overall, this project was invaluable in solidifying foundational concepts in web development, and specifically, in understanding the power and flexibility of JavaScript in web applications.

## Future Improvements

While this calculator serves basic purposes, future improvements can include:

- Advanced mathematical operations such as trigonometric functions, exponentials, and logarithms.
- Keyboard support for quicker calculations.
- A history feature to view past calculations.
